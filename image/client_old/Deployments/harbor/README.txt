## ðŸ“¦ RHEL 9 RPM Support

To prepare RHEL 9 in an airgapped environment:

1. Use the airgap script (`download_rpms.sh`) to collect required RPMs:
   - `docker`, `docker-compose`, `openssl`, and dependencies
2. Transfer the resulting `.rpm` packages to the target system
3. Install with:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install *.rpm
